# Octoprint-Printinfo Plugin
This plugin allows you to send information about your 3D printing job to a WordPress website. It sends information such as the filename, filament length, print time, printer name, and temperatures. It also sends updates on the print progress as it happens.

Generate from https://pass.node0a.com, scroll down on the page and find the token section. (each page reload a new token is generated, but you only need one)
